## Features

DataGenie offers a comprehensive set of tools for data scientists, analysts, and enthusiasts:

- **Synthetic Dataset Generation**:
  - Create realistic datasets using natural language prompts (e.g., "Generate 500 rows of customer data with name, age, and purchase amount").
  - Powered by Faker and Groq API for dynamic, domain-specific data.
  - Download generated datasets as CSV files.

- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Clean datasets by removing duplicates and missing values.
  - Detect outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
  - Encode categorical variables with LabelEncoder.
  - Placeholder for advanced transformations (e.g., scaling, PCA).

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualize data with histograms, box plots, scatter plots, count plots, correlation heatmaps, and time series plots.
  - Supports Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly for static and interactive visualizations.
  - Download visualizations as PNG files.

- **Machine Learning**:
  - Train models for classification (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, KNN), regression (Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR, Decision Tree), clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN, Agglomerative), and time series forecasting (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA).
  - Perform hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV.
  - Analyze feature importance using Random Forest.
  - Evaluate models with metrics like accuracy, F1 score, RÂ², and more.

- **Chat with Dataset**:
  - Upload a CSV and ask natural language questions (e.g., "What is the average of column X?").
  - Groq API generates executable Python code to answer queries, with support for visualizations.

- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Built with Streamlit for an intuitive, responsive UI.
  - Custom styling with Roboto fonts and downloadable outputs.
  - Sidebar navigation for preprocessing, ML, and visualizations.
  - Example prompts for inspiration across domains like finance, healthcare, and education.

   cd DataGenie
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   If `requirements.txt` is not provided, install the following:
   ```bash
   pip install streamlit pandas numpy faker groq matplotlib seaborn plotly scikit-learn
   ```

   Optional (for time series):
   ```bash
   pip install statsmodels
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
     ```bash
     touch .env
     ```
   - Add your Groq API key:
     ```
     GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
     ```

5. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   - Open your browser to `http://localhost:8501` to access DataGenie.

## Deployment

### Hugging Face Spaces
DataGenie is deployed at [https://huggingface.co/spaces/MahatirTusher/DataGenie](https://huggingface.co/spaces/MahatirTusher/DataGenie). To deploy your own instance:

1. **Create a Hugging Face Space**:
   - Go to [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces).
   - Create a new Space with the Streamlit SDK.

2. **Upload Files**:
   - Push `app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and `.env` (with secrets configured in Space settings).

3. **Configure Secrets**:
   - Add your `GROQ_API_KEY` in the Space's secrets settings.

4. **Deploy**:
   - Commit changes to trigger a build. The Space will be live once the build completes.

### Local Deployment with Docker
1. Create a `Dockerfile`:
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   WORKDIR /app
   COPY . /app

   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   EXPOSE 8501
   CMD ["streamlit", "run", "app.py", "--server.port=8501", "--server.address=0.0.0.0"]
   ```

2. Build and Run:
   ```bash
   docker build -t datagenie .
   docker run -p 8501:8501 --env-file .env datagenie
   ```

## Usage

1. **Generate Synthetic Data**:
   - Go to the "Dataset Generator" tab.
   - Enter a prompt (e.g., "Generate 1000 rows of patient data with age, blood pressure, and diagnosis").
   - Click "Generate Code" to preview the Python code, then "Get the Dataset" to view and download the data.

2. **Upload and Analyze Data**:
   - Upload a CSV in the header or "Chat with Dataset" tab.
   - Use the sidebar to clean data, detect outliers, encode variables, or visualize features.

3. **Train ML Models**:
   - Select "Select ML Models" in the sidebar.
   - Choose a task (classification, regression, clustering, time series), target/features, and model.
   - Train and view performance metrics.

4. **Chat with Dataset**:
   - Upload a CSV and ask questions like "Show the top 5 rows" or "Plot a histogram of column X".
   - Execute generated code to see results or visualizations.

5. **Explore Example Prompts**:
   - Check the "Example Prompts" tab for inspiration across domains like finance, healthcare, and retail.

## Example Prompts

Here are some prompts to try in the "Dataset Generator" tab:

- **Finance**: "Generate 1000 customer records for a bank with age, income, loan amount, credit score, and defaulted (Yes/No)."
- **Healthcare**: "Create 500 rows of patient data with age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol, and diagnosis (Healthy, At Risk, Critical)."
- **Education**: "Generate 700 student records with study hours, attendance, and final grade (A, B, C, D, F)."
- **Retail**: "Generate 1000 rows of purchase data with customer ID, product category, purchase amount, and payment method."

See the "Example Prompts" tab in the app for more ideas!
